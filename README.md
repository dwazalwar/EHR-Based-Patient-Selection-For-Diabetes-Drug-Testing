## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
Develop a deep learning regression model to predict the expected hospitalization time for patients using electronic health records (EHR) data. The model helps identify ideal candidates for clinical trials of a new diabetes drug that requires extended inpatient monitoring.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview  
The project builds an end-to-end predictive pipeline using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability, integrating categorical and numerical features from EHR datasets. The steps include:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering with **ICD, CPT, and NDC medical codes**.
- Training a deep learning model with **Bayesian layers** for uncertainty quantification.
- **Bias evaluation** using Aequitas to assess fairness across demographic groups.
- Deploying a classification system that flags patients as eligible or ineligible for clinical trials.

## Clinical Significance  
EHR data offers real-world evidence that informs drug trials and healthcare decisions. Accurately predicting hospitalization duration:
- Optimizes patient selection for resource-intensive treatments.
- Reduces unnecessary costs by targeting the right candidates.
- Ensures ethical and fair inclusion across different demographics.
- Supports regulatory decision-making by validating **trial feasibility**.

## ðŸ“¦ About the Dataset

- **Size:** 54,271 unique patient encounters after preprocessing
- **Target variable:** time_in_hospital (continuous variable for regression)
- **Key features:** Demographics, medical codes (ICD, NDC), clinical measurements, and hospital utilization metrics

### Data Schema Overview:
- **Patient identifiers:** encounter_id, patient_nbr
- **Demographics:** race, gender, age (bucketed)
- **Clinical features:** diagnosis codes, lab procedures, medications
- **Utilization metrics:** outpatient/inpatient/emergency visits

## Bias Analysis and Fairness Evaluation

### Aequitas Framework Analysis
- **Reference Group:** Caucasian males used as the reference.
- **Gender Bias Assessment:**  
  - **Statistical Parity:** Achieved across gender groups.
  - **Equalized Odds:** No significant disparity in true positive and false negative rates.
  - **Precision Parity:** Balanced performance observed between male and female patients.
- **Racial Bias Assessment:**  
  - African American patients showed slight differences in prediction rates, but these were within acceptable thresholds.
  - Asian and Hispanic patients had limited sample sizes, affecting statistical power.
  - **Overall Assessment:** No evidence of significant racial bias in patient selection.
- **Key Fairness Metrics:**  
  - False Positive Rate Parity, True Positive Rate Parity, and Positive Predictive Value were consistent across demographic groups.

Overall, the comprehensive bias evaluation using the Aequitas toolkit indicates that the model operates with equitable fairness across both gender and racial groups.
